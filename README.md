Ratecard and CRM Dynamics 365 Workflow Plugin Integration
https://get.ratecard.io/

## How does this work?
You install and register this application with CRM Dynamics 365 using any tool you see fit.
Once installed, you can create a workflow like normally and you can find the Ratecard plugin listed there. 

I've personally used it to trigger upon creation of a appointment and phone calls. 
Anything else you need, you would have to modify the code to make it work. But at least you have a starting point from here.
